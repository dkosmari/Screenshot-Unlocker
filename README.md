# Screenshot Unlocker

Some Wii U games and apps disable the upload of screenshots through the Home Menu's web
browser. This plugin overrides the setting, to always enable screenshots.

Note: this plugin has no relationship to the [official Screenshot
plugin](https://github.com/wiiu-env/ScreenshotWUPS) from Aroma.


## Usage

This plugin has no settings. Just open any game or app that would normally disable
screenshots, and try to upload them.
